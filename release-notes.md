# Release notes
{: #release-notes}

The following new features and changes to {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudiofull}} are available.
{: shortdesc}

## March 2020
{: #march-2020}

**Enhanced pre-annotation workflow.**
  - Run multiple pre-annotators at once and configure the order of pre-annotators to resolve annotation conflicts between them. Existing pre-annotator results are preserved unless you remove them with the **Wipe** option.
  - Human annotations are preserved when running pre-annotators, even when using the *Wipe* option.

## December 2019
{: #december-2019}

### New features and changes
{: #new-december-2019}

- **New advanced rules tokenizer** Advanced rules has introduced a new tokenizer which is not compatible with the previous one. The following extractor categories are affected:
  - **Parts of Speech** extractor names are renamed automatically
    - **Cardinal** is renamed to **Numeral**
    - **Preposition** is renamed to **Adposition**
  - **Machine Data Analytics** Splitter extractors have been removed and will disappear from the canvas. There is no substitute for these extractors that is provided by the new tokenizer.
    - Generic Splitters:
      - **Date Time Splitter**
      - **Day First Splitter**
      - **Month First Splitter**
      - **Year First Splitter**
    - Syslog Splitter:
      - **Date Time Splitter**  
- **Cross-sentence relations (Experimental)**: English entities and relations workspaces can now support annotating relations between entities within spans of six sentences. To get started, see [Enabling cross-sentence relations](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-enabling-cross-sentence-relations).

- **Service URL changes**

    - The service endpoints have changed to use a different domain and include the service instance ID. The pattern is `api.{location}.{offering}.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}`.

        The previous public endpoint domain was `watsonplatform.net`.

        These URLs do not introduce a breaking change. The new URLs work both for your existing service instances and for new instances. The original URLs continue to work on your existing service instances for at least one year (until December 2020).

| Region | Old | New |
|--|--|--|
| Dallas | `gateway.watsonplatform.net` | `us-south.knowledge-studio.watson.cloud.ibm.com` |

## November 2019
{: #november-2019

### New features and changes
{: #new-november-2019}

- **New South Korea location**: You can now create {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instances in the Seoul location. As with other locations, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Seoul location uses token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

## October 2019
{: #october-2019}

### New features and changes
{: #new-october-2019}

- Advanced rules workspaces (Beta) are now available for service instances in **Dallas** and **Frankfurt**. Create advanced rules extractors and run them to extract text from documents that you upload to the workspace. To get started, see [Creating an advanced rules model](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-create-advanced-rules-model).
- **Dictionary suggestions:** As you add entries to a dictionary, {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} will search the documents in your workspace to recommend additional entries that are likely to be in the same domain.

{: #new-dec2018}

-  Introduced support to deploy the same machine learning model version to multiple service instances and general improvements to the **Version History and Deployment** page. For information about deploying multiple instances of the same model version see [Deploying the same model version to multiple services](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-publish-ml#wks_secdep)

-  Added the `models` method to the {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} service allowing users to list deployed {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} models.


## September 2018
{: #sept2018}

### New features and changes
{: #new-sept2018}

- Introduced support for HTML, DOC, DOCX, and PDF files. For information about the supported document types, size limits, and other information, see  [Creating a workspace > Machine learning model > Document management](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-create-project#machine-learning-model). For information about adding documents for annotation, see [Adding documents to a workspace](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-documents-for-annotation#wks_projadd).

## August 2018
{: #august2018}

### New features and changes
{: #new-august2018}

- Introduced a new option for automated migration of Standard plan instances from the deprecated {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace platform to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/12/watson-knowledge-studio-ibm-cloud/){: new_window}. If you have a Standard instance on the deprecated platform, you'll have the option to migrate. For more information, see [Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-migrate).

## July 2018
{: #july2018}

### New features and changes
{: #new-july2018}

- The **Deployed Models** page was updated to include models from {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instances that are managed by [IAM *resource groups* ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles){: new_window}, in addition to models that are managed by [Cloud Foundry *organizations* ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/docs/iam?topic=iam-cfaccess){: new_window}.

   What you see on the Deployed Models page depends on the [region ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/docs/resources?topic=resources-services_region){: new_window} that hosts your {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} instance. If the region supports instances managed by both access management methods, you see a tab for each method. Models from instances that are managed by IAM are listed on the **Resource Groups** tab. Models from instances that are managed by Cloud Foundry are listed on the **Organizations** tab.

  If the region supports instances managed by only one of the access management methods, you see only one list of models, because only one access management method is applicable.

   To view the **Deployed Models** page, from the **Settings** menu in the top right menu bar, click **Manage deployed models**. For information about undeploying models on the **Deployed Models** page, see [Undeploying machine learning models](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-publish-ml#undeploy-view-model) and [Undeploying rule-based models](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-wks_rule_publish#undeploy-view-model).

- The navigation was changed to better align with the {{site.data.keyword.knowledgestudioshort}} workflow. Also, the following functionality was reorganized:

    - In the previous version, management of dictionaries was included as part of the Pre-annotators page. Now, management of dictionaries is located on the Dictionaries page in the Assets section of the navigation.
    - In the previous version, human annotation functionality was distributed across the Mentions, Relations, and Coreferences tabs in the Document Annotation section of the navigation. Now, the functionality is merged under the Annotation Tasks page in the Machine Learning Model section of the navigation.
    - To manage human annotation tasks, in the previous version, you found the Tasks tab under the Assets & Tools > Documents page. Now, you add tasks and manage existing tasks on the Annotation Tasks page in the Machine Learning Model section of the navigation.
    - In the previous version, the Rules, Regex and Dictionaries pages were separate pages in the Document Annotation section of the navigation. Now, the functionality is merged under the Rules page in the Rule-based Model section of the navigation.

    For more details about the navigation changes, see Figure 1 and Table 3.

{: #issues-sept17}

- For a rule-based model, after you map classes and entity types, the **Export** button is not enabled until you refresh the browser window.
- For the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-troubleshooting#experimental) release, some of the documentation terminology does not match the new interface. The documentation matches the interface in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace. The following terms have changed in the [experimental](/docs/services/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-troubleshooting#experimental) release:

| Term in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Marketplace | Term in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|
| _project_ | _workspace_ | This term was changed because {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also uses the term _project_ |
| _import_ and _export_ | _upload_ and _download_ | The terms _import_ and _export_ are now referred to as _upload_ and _download_ when used in terms of documents and entity types. The term _export_ is still used when referring to exporting a model to applications such as {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer. |
